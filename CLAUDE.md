# Project Requirements

Build a single page webapp, nodejs based, no backend. It shows endless fireworks animation on the page. Keep it simple - just HTML/CSS/JavaScript with a canvas element for the fireworks. Use vibrant colors, particle effects, and continuous random fireworks launching from the bottom of the screen. Include a dark background for best visual effect.

## Conventions
- Keep code simple and readable
- Use standard library where possible
- Include brief comments for non-obvious logic
